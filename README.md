# ⚡ DSA Instructor Chatbot

Welcome to the DSA Instructor Chatbot — a sleek, responsive web-based assistant built to help users master Data Structures and Algorithms. Designed with TailwindCSS and powered by Gemini 2.5 Flash API, this chatbot delivers fast, focused, and sometimes hilariously rude responses to off-topic questions (by design 😈).
## 🚀 Features

- 💬 Interactive chat interface with animated message bubbles
- 🎨 Dark-themed UI with custom gradients and TailwindCSS styling
- 📱 Mobile-friendly sidebar toggle
- 🧠 Gemini 2.5 Flash API integration for intelligent DSA responses
- ⚠️ Rude replies for non-DSA queries (because boundaries matter)
- 📜 Navigation links for History, Settings, and Tutorial (alerts for now)
- 📞 Footer with social links and contact info
